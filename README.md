# Asciidoctor Setup Action

This Action can install
    [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/)
to a virtual machine of GitHub Actions. 


## Usage

Given that Ruby has already been installed 
(e.g. by [ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-ruby-jruby-and-truffleruby)), 
include this in your workflow:

```yml
 - uses: reitzig/actions-asciidoctor@v2.0.0
```

These inputs are allowed:

 - `version` -- a [Gemfile-compatible version string](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#declaring-dependencies)  
   _Default:_ empty; installs the latest version.

### Working Example

```yml
name: Asciidoctor Demo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7

      - uses: reitzig/actions-asciidoctor@v2.0.0
        with:
          version: 2.0.18

      - run: asciidoctor --version
```
